# TODO

[X] 1. `ok()`: take a value and wrap it in `{:ok, value}`
    - [ ] Implement ok() as macro
[X] 2. `error()`: take a value and wrap it in `{:error, value}`
   - [ ] Implement ok() as macro
[X] 3. `id()`: function that returns the value it's given
   - [X] Implement as alias to Function.identity/1
[X] 4. `tuple_wrap()`: macro that runs whatever you give it and returns {:error, ???} if it raises, otherwise {:ok, value}
[ ] 5. Create a Monad protocol with `bind()` or something, maybe using that one safe operator, what's it?
    [ ] - Make it a Protocol and define it for tuples
    [ ] - Take a function and a maybe value (result tuple)
    [ ] - If it's an error tuple, pass it through
    [ ] - If it's an ok tuple, run the value through the function, which presumably returns another tuple
[ ] 6. Create a Functor Protocol with an fmap implementation and some kind of <$> style operator
   - [ ] Implement for lists: just Enum.map
   - [ ] Implement for result tuples
   - [ ] Implement for BitString so that you can do fmap("foo", &String.upcase/1) and get "FOO" instead of ["F", "O", "O"]
[ ] 7. Add an applicative protocol
  - [ ] Especially for applying lists of functions
[ ] 8. unwrap functions
[ ]   a. `unwrap/1`
[ ]   b. `unwrap_or/1`
[ ] 9. Implement Enumerable for String
   - [ ] Use `Enumerable.impl_for("")` to avoid re-implementing via macro
[ ] 10. Create a pseudo Enum type
[ ] 11. Use &&& and !!! as Monadic operators
    - Short circuits
    - If f/1 and g/1 both return result tuples, then...
    - f(a) &&& g(b) returns g(b) if both succeed, or else the first error
    - f(a) ||| g(b) returns the first successful result, or else the last error
