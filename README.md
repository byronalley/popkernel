# Popkernel

**Functions that should be in Kernel but aren't**

A lot of this little library is an attempt to write helpers that apply monad patterns but in what should feel like an idiomatic Elixir way.

But more generally it's an experiment looking at things that seem like they should already be in the `Kernel` library and aren't, so the intent is that this library should be use via `import` so that the functions feel like part of the language.
